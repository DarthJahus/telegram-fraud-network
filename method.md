## Documentation Principles

- Documentation is link-driven.
- An entity is documented only if it is linked to an already known entity or consists of a new hub of activity
- Links reflect the direction of discovery.

## Minimal Information

Each entity file may contain:
- Telegram ID (or invitation link placeholder)
- type: `channel` | `group` | `user`
- functional Telegram link
- links to:
- owner / admin (if visible)
- bio and external links (if present)
- observed status (`active` | `banned` | `deleted`) with date
