## Observed Moderation Behavior

Based on repeated observations:

- moderation actions target individual channels or groups
- related accounts often remain active
- no cumulative sanction effects are visible at the account level
- bans appear isolated and non-propagating

These observations are empirical and based solely on public behavior.
