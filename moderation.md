## Observed Moderation Behavior

Based on repeated observations:

- moderation actions target individual channels or groups
- related accounts often remain active
- no observable cumulative sanction effects are visible at the telegram_account level
- bans appear isolated and non-propagating
- Sanctions appear to be applied per entity instance, not accumulated across related accounts.

These observations are empirical and based solely on public behavior.

Observed moderation behavior is interpreted through graph persistence
and reconfiguration.
