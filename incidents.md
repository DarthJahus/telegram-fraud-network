## Incidents
An incident represents the exposure of victim-related information.

An incident file may contain:
- victim name(s) or identifier(s)
- where the data appeared
- type of exposed information
- link to the Telegram post
- associated backup filename (if any)
- reporting status (reported / not reported) and link to report

Incidents are distinct from channels. They document harm, not infrastructure.

Incidents may result in external reports.
