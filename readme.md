## Telegram Fraud Network
This repository documents a manual OSINT-based method to observe and
document fraud-related activity on Telegram.

The focus is not on automation or scraping, but on:
- persistent Telegram accounts (channels, groups, users)
- observable links between them
- the effects and limits of Telegram moderation actions

The repository also provides a reproducible documentation method
that can be used by researchers, journalists, or investigators.
