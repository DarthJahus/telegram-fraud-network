## Actions Following Observation
This methodology distinguishes observation from action.

Actions are proportional, documented and limited to public reporting
mechanisms.

### Activity Classification
Each documented entity is tagged according to observed activity.
Multiple tags may apply to a single entity when different activity types coexist.

Common tags include:
- #bankaccounts — sale of compromised or stolen bank accounts, often with
  associated methods (2FA bypass, cash-out tutorials, tooling)
- #checking — sale of bank checks (mostly USA-based), often partially blurred,
  frequently linked to ATM or mobile deposit cash-out methods
- #investment_scam — cryptocurrency, forex, or "pay and receive double"
  investment fraud schemes
- #backup — channel or group used as dorment or inactive redirection hub
- #hub — channel or group whose primary function is redirection

Tags are descriptive, not accusatory.

#### Hub Definition
A hub is a channel or group whose primary function is redirection:
- forwards users to other channels, groups, or sellers
- acts as a distribution or aggregation point
- minimal direct illegal activity posting
- high outbound link density

Hubs are distinguished from backup channels by their active redirection role.

### Telegram Reporting
All observed illegal activity is reported to Telegram via the application
interface:
- right click on message or entity
- report
- select category
- short contextual comment

This step is always performed, regardless of activity type.

### Proportional Response
If no victim exposure is observed:
- no external escalation is performed
- the entity is monitored
- Telegram is given time to act

Observation may continue without further action.

### Incident Handling
When an incident involving victim data exposure is observed:
- the incident is documented separately
- the feasibility of an IC3 report is evaluated
- if applicable, an IC3 report is submitted

IC3 reports are linked to:
- the incident
- the involved Telegram accounts
- the observation date
- evidence is preserved

#### IC3 Reporting Criteria
An IC3 report is submitted when:
- a physical person (victim) is clearly identifiable
- personal information is exposed (name, address, documents, financial data)
- the exposure constitutes potential fraud or identity theft

Generic data dumps or anonymized information do not trigger IC3 reports.

### External Infrastructure
When a website is involved:
- WHOIS information is retrieved and preserved
- the registrar and/or hosting provider is identified
- abuse contacts are notified
- website is archived

All communications are archived when possible.

## Explicit Non-Actions
The following actions are deliberatey not performed:
- contacting victims to warn them of exposure
- contacting sellers or requesting illegal services
- purchasing or soliciting stolen data
- engaging in baiting that would involve third-party

## Scam Baiting Boundaries
Scam baiting is considered acceptable only in cases where:
- the activity is an investment scam
- no third-party data or assets are involved
- the interaction involves only the scammer and the observer

Baiting is never performed for:
- stolen data
- bank accounts
- checks
- weapons
