## Graph Construction

The graph emerges from observed relations:
- calls to action
- admin or owner visibility
- bio links
- invitation links
- forwards

No inferred or speculative links are added.

## Post-Ban Observation

When a channel or group is banned:
- the ban is recorded with observation date
- no immediate conclusion is drawn
- related entities are observed over time

In practice, activity often resumes through:
- backup channels
- connected accounts
- direct user migration
